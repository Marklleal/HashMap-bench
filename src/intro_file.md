# How This Book Works
## Introducing
This book was created with the aim of exploring new tools and arriving at a result interesting enough that it could be published as something that would help anyone who was interested.

Topics like HashMap accesses in Rust and benchmarking with criterion will be addressed in this book.

If you have never read anything created with mdbook, you will see interesting features throughout this book.

## Code That Runs In The Browser
If you hover your pointer over the right upper corner of code blocks, you'll see a clickable play icon. When you click it, the code in the block will run and the output will be printed below the code block. Sometimes we get some timeout errors, but you can just run it again and the result will be printed.

## Code That Is Hidden To Focus On Essencial
Again, if you hover your pointer over the right upper corner of code blocks, you'll see a one more clickable icon, but instead of a play icon, it's an eye. If you click on it, you'll see part of the code that's hidden, the reasons for this are various, but most of the time, it's to bring focus to an important part of the code. Reading the entire block of code could hinder your reasoning.

## Plots Are Synchronized
Throughout the book, you will see some plots of the benchmark. well, when you scroll one of that plots, the plot next to it will scroll in the same direction, to make it easier to analyze the plots.
